## Commits

- Use prefix like feat:, fix:, refactor: for commits, see complete list of prefix here: [https://gist.github.com/joshbuchea/6f47e86d2510bce28f8e7f42ae84c716](https://gist.github.com/joshbuchea/6f47e86d2510bce28f8e7f42ae84c716)

## Codestyle

- Remove console.log.
- Avoid code duplicate.
- Use "Sentence case" for texts and titles on UI, not "Title Case".
- Use official casing for trademarks, do: WalletConnect, GitHub, don't do: Wallet Connect, Github.
- Simpler is better, avoid adding extra complexity.
- The less code you use the better is it.
- Add types in your code.

## Create a pull request

- Link your pull request to an issue, a pull request should solve only 1 issue, if you want solve 2 issues you should do 2 separate pull requests.
